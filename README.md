# Chat App

A simple chat app made using the MERN stack.

Started working on the project using Javascipt for both the frontend and backend. The backend made using Express acts as a REST API which is being consumed by the frontend using API calls. 
The frontend was made using React.js and Material-UI in javascript at first and then was later shifted to Typescript.

## Frameworks used:
* Express
* MongoDB
* Reactjs
* Material-UI
* Typescript

Future plans include adding Voice and Video calling capabilities using WebRTC.
